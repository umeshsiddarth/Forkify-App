# Forkify App

This project is part of the JavaScript course titled 'The Complete JavaScript Course' by Jonas Schmedtmann. The primary goal of this project is to implement JavaScript functionalities while utilizing the provided HTML/CSS files as starter templates.

## Project Overview

Forkify is a web app that allows users to explore various dishes and recipes. Users can search for specific food items, view different recipe varieties, and even create and store their own recipes locally. The project covers a range of important concepts in web development using JavaScript, including:

- Handling API calls
- Error handling
- DOM manipulation
- Pagination and search functionality
- Storing bookmarks
- Uploading new recipes, with access limited to the creator
- Writing clean code

## Architecture Used

Model-View-Controller(MVC) Architecture

## Learning Outcomes

Throughout the course of this project, you will gain practical experience and understanding of the following concepts:

- API integration and data retrieval
- Sending data to API
- Error handling and debugging techniques
- Manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM)
- Implementing DOM Algorithm
- Implementing Publisher Subscriber pattern for event handlers
- Implementing pagination and search functionality
- Using local storage for storing and retrieving user data
- Writing clean and efficient JavaScript code
- Following industry standard architecture like Model-View-Controller (MVC)

## Project Features

### Search and Find Recipes

Effortlessly search and discover a wide range of recipes tailored to your preferences. The application provides a user-friendly interface for efficient recipe exploration.

### Dynamic Serving Adjustment

Easily customize the number of servings for a recipe, and watch as the quantities adjust dynamically. This feature ensures flexibility in adapting recipes to suit different occasions and serving sizes.

### Bookmark Your Favorites

Bookmark your most loved recipes for quick access. The application allows you to curate a collection of favorite recipes for future reference.

### Create and Manage Your Own Recipes

Unleash your culinary creativity by adding and managing your own recipes. The app empowers you to document and organize your unique culinary creations seamlessly.

### Persistent Bookmarks and Recipes

Your bookmarks and created recipes are securely stored, allowing you to pick up right where you left off. Whether you return to the app after a brief break or an extended period, your preferences and creations remain intact for a seamless and personalized experience.

## Architecture Used

- Model-View-Controller Architecture

## Technology

- HTML, CSS, Javascript

## Libraries

### Fractional

A library used for precise handling of fractional numbers, ensuring accurate representation in recipe quantity adjustments.

### regenerator-runtime:

This library enables the use of ECMAScript 6 generators, enhancing asynchronous programming capabilities in the application.

### core-js:

core-js is employed to provide essential polyfills for modern JavaScript features, ensuring cross-browser compatibility and a smooth user experience.

## External APIs

### Forkify API

The Forkify API serves as a valuable resource for accessing an extensive database of recipes. It powers the recipe search and retrieval functionality in the application.

### Demo

## Development Tools

### Parcel

Parcel is utilized as the application bundler, simplifying the build process and optimizing the deployment of assets.

### Babel

Babel is used for transpiling modern JavaScript code into a compatible version for a wide range of browsers. It ensures the application remains accessible across various environments.

## Future Enhancements (To Do)

### Improvements

- Display number of pages (Cur Page out of Total Pages)
- Ability to sort search result by duration or number of ingredients
- Form validation before submitting
- Improve the add recipe form structure

### Feature Additons

- Weekly meal planning feature: Assign recipes for the next 7 days and show on a weekly calendar
- Get nutrition data on each ingredient from spoonacular API (https://spoonacular.com/food-api) and calculate total calories of recipe
